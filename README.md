<h2>Conway's Game Of Life, in Go!</h2>
<p>Conway's Game of Life, sometimes just called "life" is a cellular automaton created by John Conway in 1970. <br>
Ever since learning about life I've always wanted to build it and since I'm learning Go, I figured this would be the perfect project to do so.</p>
